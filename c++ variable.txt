C++ Variables

varaile are container for storing data values 
in C++, there are differents type of variables(defined with differents keywords), for example:
    int  - stores intergers(whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
    double - stores floatin point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
    char - stores single characters,such as 'a' or 'B', Char values are surrounded by single quotes
    string - stores text, such as "Hello world", Sring values are surrounded by double quotes
    bool - stores values with two states: true or false

boolean can have 1 byte of size
char can have 1 byte of size
int can have 2 or 4 bytes of size
float can have 4 bytes of size
double can have 8 bytes of size

Scientific numbers

a floating point number can also be a scientific number with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
Example
float f1 = 35e3;
double d1 = 12E4;
cout << f1;
cout << d1;
